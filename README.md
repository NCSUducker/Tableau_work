For this Tableau work book I briefly examined Data from the New York Citi Bike Program and found interesting phenomenons regarding the time of year usage and usage by user.

In August of 2020 it is observed that the 'Subscriber' typically has a longer tripduration when compared to 'Customer'; However, from August 2020-August2021 it is evident that subscribers on average have shorter trip durations.

From the 'user by gender' chart we can see that (Gender range from 0 to 3, 0 being unknown; 1=male; 2=female)Males on average have a longer trip duration when compared to the trip duration of females

Observing usage by the time of year It is observed that in August of 2020 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' users are fairly active compared to one another. When we compare this data to January of 2021, we can see that active users plummets for both 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' users. Along with this the Average trip duration for 'Subscriber' users declines almost by half, whereas 'Customer' users tripduration appeared to dip only slightly
